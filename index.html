    <p>Lionesses are independent, fierce, loyal, brave, strong, graceful and agile. They are the primary hunters of their pride and are highly protective over their young. Male lions are large and heavy with a lazy disposition. Within a pride they are quite placid unless they're fighting with incoming males.</p>
